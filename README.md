## About This Workshop
The HTML is already good to go! We're going to build out the
vanilla javascript in `script.js` and the styling in `style.css`.

See the `checkpoints/` folder to follow along. In addition the final 
working solution is available in the `solution` branch.

There are already images set up in the `images/` folder, and a
corresponding data array in the `script.js` file.

Key concepts for this workshop include:
   - Accessing form inputs and buttons with the `document` API 
      (document.addEventListener, document.getElementById, element.value)
   - Using `console.log()` to create debug messages in the console
   - Functions and function callbacks
   - Using `Number()` to convert strings to numbers
   - Using `toFixed()` to turn a number into a string with fixed decimal points
   - Using `const` and `let` to create variables
   - Objects and Arrays (arrays of planet objects!)
   - Using a for-loop to iterate over an array of objects
   - Accessing key/value pairs of an object
   - Appending html and CSS to the DOM using `document.insertAdjacentHTML`
   - Clearing the innerHTML using `element.innerHTML`
   - Using string templating to insert variable data into a string
